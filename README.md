# HSC_scRNA-ATAC_seq
This repository contains code and analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, focusing on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The project includes data processing, visualization, and integration of multi-omics data to study gene regulation and cell differentiation.
